      <p class="missionText">Many people around the world have passions for art, but may not have the experience or tools necessary to pursue this passion. Our goal is to walk artists, regardless of experience, through basic art concepts, like color theory, anatomy, harmony, and more, to help people in less privileged circumstances learn how to do what they love and express their creativity. Art is so important because it adds meaning to peopleâ€™s lives and allows us to have a deeper understanding of their emotions.
